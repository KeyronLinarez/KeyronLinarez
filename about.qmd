title: "About Me"
---

Hello, my name is Keyron (they/them), I am a current senior studying computer science at Pomona college. I am a first generation student and a Questbridge scholar, and I really love to learn. Currently, my main fixations are roller-blading, punk guitar and grinding F-Zero 99.

I am deeply interested in software engineering, art and education. I've had the immense privilege of pursuing all three at various points in my career. Before college, I worked closely with Next Generation Scholars to bring robotics and block-based programming classes to my community. Throughout college, I've worked on robotics and safe reinforcement learning for autonomous driving, User-Based Research and Data Mining, and lots of music! (I've been taking voice lessons for 2 years now, and was the Pomona College Band manager on Trumpet :))

I've included some of my projects for you to see on my website: several of my research, data science, and programming projects from the last several years. Thanks for stopping by!
