Hello, my name is Keyron (they/them), I am a current senior studying computer science at Pomona college. I am a first generation student and a Questbridge scholar, and I really like video games :3

I've included some of my projects for you to see on my website: research, data science, and programming projects from the last several years. Thanks for stopping by!
