    "text": "Using the “College tuition, diversity, and pay” data set, I will be analyzing the differences in cost/tuition between public and private schools. I will filter out the data in order to make a fair comparison between the two categories (e.g. schools in the same region), then compare the difference between their costs. Here is a link to my data set: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-03-10/readme.md\nMy research questions: Alternative claim: Tuition rates are higher for private universities than for public universities Null claim: Tuition rates do not differ between public and private universities.\nI am only interested in the total cost for students attending schools in-state, in California. This way, the cost-of-living is fairly looked at (since comparing Californiaa schools with Maine schools, for example, would not be fair).\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Sorting my data:\nCA_schools &lt;- tuition_cost |&gt;\n  select(name, state_code, type, in_state_tuition) |&gt;\n  filter(state_code == \"CA\")\n\n\n# public schools\npublic_schools &lt;- tuition_cost |&gt;\n  select(name, state_code, type, in_state_tuition) |&gt;\n  filter(type == \"Public\") |&gt;\n  filter(state_code == \"CA\")\n\npublic_mean &lt;- public_schools |&gt;\n  summarize(mean_cost = mean(in_state_tuition, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n#145 total public schools\npublic_schools\n\n# A tibble: 145 × 4\n   name                                        state_code type  in_state_tuition\n   &lt;chr&gt;

We then created a random sampling by cutting a slice of elements from the data set of all Californian schools, and randomly shuffling their tuition values. We ran this over 2000 iterations, and found that there is strong evidence for the null hypothesis in this case."
